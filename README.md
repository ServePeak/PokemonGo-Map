# Pokémon Go Twitter Feed![Python 2.7](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-2.7-blue.svg)


Twitter feed for selected "rare" Pokémon. 
Based off [AHAAAAAAA's PokemonGo Map](https://github.com/AHAAAAAAA/PokemonGo-Map), instead of continuously checking a map, now you can have a twitter feed tell you where the Pokémon are.
